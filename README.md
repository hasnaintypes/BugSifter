# BugSifter
BugSifter is a totaly awesome cli utility tool to filter txt files.

## How to Use

1. Build it (somehow):
```
g++ -o bugsifter src/*.cpp
```

2. Run it like this:
```
./bugsifter data/sample.txt
```

3. Wait for the magic.

## What it Does?
- Removes the vowels 
- Loggs to a file called `bugsifter.log`
- Has a clearScreen function

## TODO
- More filters
- Multithreading? maybe idk
- Fix bugs if found by someone
